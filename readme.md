#Meet landing page by Aziah Daniel
This is a solution to the Meet landing page challenge by Amalitech. The goal was to build the reference project from scrach to look as close to the figma file provided.



#What I learned
As a result of this challenge, I have acquired several useful and fundamental web design concepts including but not limited to Responsive web design using Media Queries, Css layout techniques (Flexbox and Grides) as well as accessibility standards. 

Furthermore, I was able to design separate versions for different screen sizes including Desktop, Tablet and Mobile.
